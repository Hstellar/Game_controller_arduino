The device consists of a simple controller that is made up of an embedded sensor,               the accelerometer. The game we will make will be a car racing game made using               the Unity web engine. The player would control the movement of the car in the               game by simply turning the hand wrist, which would turn the car, accordingly. If              the player wants to turn the car to the right side of the lane, the playerwillsimply                  turn their wrist and the car will turn; likewise, to turn to the right side of the lane,                  the player will turn the wrist to the left. Furthermore, the gears can be manually               changed by entering the gear number in a keypad. The default gear will begear1,                which can be changed gradually to gear 5 as the car accelerates, just like gears               change in a manual gear car. The game data will be shared through either the               ethernet module or thebluetoothmodule.Thespeedofthecarwillbedisplayedon               a LCD and the camera view can be changed from 4x4 keyboard.
